# Modelling spatial accessibility of homecare workers to the elderly population in the city of Zurich

This repository contains all the necessary R code and data to reproduce the findings of the paper "Modelling spatial accessibility of homecare workers to the elderly population in the city of Zurich". Running the script *spatial_accessibility.rmd* will result in loading and processing of the relevant data and subsequently in the computation and visualization of the various Floating-Catchment-Area methods. It additionally contains the code used to generate the various figures displayed within the paper.

The script further contains functions for the calculation of the Two-Step- and the Enhanced-Two-Step-Floating-Catchment-Area methods. For the computation of the Three-Step- and the Modified-Huff-Model-Three-Step-Floating-Catchment-Area methods, the [fca package provided by Gr√ºebler et al. (2021)](https://egrueebler.github.io/fca/) was used.
